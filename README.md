# Calculator
This is my first really Android application that i am developing.
It is a simple implementation of an calculator with an interactive design.
The functionality provided is elementary mathematic operation (addition, substraction, multiplication, division) and special functionality such as percentage of an number.

Great inspiration come from the designer of this application **Alina Shipulina**  [@alinashipulina](https://twitter.com/alinashipulina). You can find it is findable on his dribbble account.
